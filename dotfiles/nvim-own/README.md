## Tips

`:set filetype?` to find out filetype. There seems to be no way to find the name of the treesitter
language for the filetype - you just need to know `typescriptreact` filetype means the `tsx`
treesitter language.

## To Do

Implement `root dir` searching
Add full ESLint support
Add full vtsls support
Add a way to see the difference between local git branch state and remote branch state (in statusline?)
